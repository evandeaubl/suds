Due to the new [GitHub Terms of
Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/) put into
effect on March 1, 2017, I can no longer legally host the Suds source code on
GitHub. The code is open source (LGPL), but originally written by another
individual, and because of that, I do not have the legal right to grant GitHub
the overly broad rights required by their Terms of Service. As this code was
developed partially as an employee, this puts my employer at the time at
(albeit infinitesimally small) legal risk, therefore the only choice was to
remove the code.

This code may reappear at a later date, if GitHub amends their ToS to allow
it, or at another comparable public git repo website. In the latter case, I
will post an updated link here.
